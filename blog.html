       Question 4
   </p>
<article>
    <h3>Does it matter to use relative size? </h3>
    <p>There are two types of length units that describe properties of the margin, padding, height… and so on. Some include %(percentage), px, rem, em. Widely grouped into two as Absolute length units and Relative length units.
        The former is used to describe the length in a fixed length as in cm mm and so on . They are not advocated to use because the size of screen differs from device to device.
        While the latter is used to describe length in a relative to the other length units. This type of length unit is recommended as in it is good for scaling while rendering our website on other devices. Rem and Em are the examples of the Relative length units.
         
        In Sense,  Relative length units should be used for a responsive outcome in-order to enable the users to control their web browsing experiences.  In general, Using relative length units helps web developers to maintain their layouts.

        Question 5
        <p>
<article>
    <h3>We said 16px is default broswer width so what does it mean when we say 200px</h3>
    <p>Default browsers width is set as 16px  by default. PX(Pixel )is an absolute measurement while rem, em are a relative length units measurements. The conversion formula is 16px=100%=1em. The browser interprets units from CSS sheets doing calculations.</p>

        Question 6
        <p>
<article>

    <h1>CSS3</h1>
       <p>CSS3 is the latest evolution of the Cascading Style Sheets language and aims at extending CSS2.1. It brings a lot of new features and additions, like circular corners, shadows, gradients, transitions or animations, as well as new layouts like multi-columns, flexible box. </p>  
<h3>CSS3 Selectors</h3>

<p>Originally, CSS allowed the matching of elements by type, class or ID. CSS2.1 added pseudo-elements, pseudo-classes, and combinators. With CSS3, we can target almost any element on the page with a wide range of selectors.</p>
    
<h3>Pseudo-classes</h3><p>Known that the user interaction pseudo-class : link, :visited, :hover, :active, and :focus, a few more pseudo-class selectors were added in CSS3. One is the :root selector, which allows designers to point to the root element of a document. In HTML, it would be <html>. Since :root is generic, it allows a designer to select the root element of an XML document without necessarily knowing it’s name. 
    A new user interaction pseudo-class selector was added, the :target selector. To draw the user’s attention to a span of text when the user clicks on a same-page link, a rule like the first line below would work nicely; the link would look like the second line, the highlighted span like the third.
    The negation pseudo-class selector, :not can be coupled with almost any other selector that has been implemented. For example to put a border around images that don’t have a border specified.
    </p>
    <h3>CSS3 Colors</h3><p>CSS3 brings with it support for some new ways of describing colors. Prior to CSS3, we almost always declared colors using the hexadecimal format. It was also possible to declare colors using the rgb () notation, providing either integers (0–255) or percentages.
        The color keyword list has been extended in the CSS3 color module to include 147 additional keyword colors . CSS3 also provides us with a number of other options: HSL, HSLA, and RGBA. The most notable change with these new color types is the ability to declare semitransparent colors.
        1.	RGBA :
        RGBA works just like RGB, except that it adds a fourth value: alpha, alpha transparency level. The first three values still represent red, green, and blue. For the alpha value, 1 means fully opaque, 0 is fully transparent, and 0.5 is 50% opaque. You can use any number between 0 and 1 inclusively.
        2. HSL and HSLA
        HSL stands for hue, saturation, and lightness. Unlike RGB, where you need to manipulate the saturation or brightness of a color by changing all three colors values in concert, with HSL you can tweak either just the saturation or the lightness while keeping the same base hue.
        The hsl( ) declaration accepts three values:
        
        The a in hsla( ) here also functions the same way as in rgba( )
        </p>
        <h3>Opacity</h3><p>CSS3 provides us with the opacity property. opacity sets the opaqueness of the element on which it’s declared, similar to alpha.</p>
<h3>Rounded Corners: border-radius</h3><p>The border-radius property lets you create rounded corners without the need for images or additional markup. </p>
<h3>Drop Shadows</h3><p>CSS3 provides the ability to add / drop shadows to elements using the box-shadow property. This property lets you specify the color, height, width, blur, and offset of one or multiple inner and/or outer drop shadows on your elements.</p>
<h3>Text Shadow</h3><p>text-shadow adds shadows to individual characters in text nodes. Prior to CSS 3, this would be done by either using an image or duplicating a text element and then positioning it.</p>
<h3>Radial Gradients</h3><p>Radial gradients are circular or elliptical gradients. Rather than proceeding along a straight axis, colors blend out from a starting point in all directions.
